# 18 NoSQL: Social Network API

## Your Task

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. 
This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. I use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. 


## Mock Up

The following animations show examples of the application's API routes being tested in Insomnia.

The following animation shows GET routes to return all users and all thoughts being tested in Insomnia:

The following animation shows GET routes to return a single user and a single thought being tested in Insomnia:

![Test2](./Assets/18-nosql-homework-demo-02.gif)

The following animation shows the POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for users being tested in Insomnia:

![Test3](./Assets/18-nosql-homework-demo-03.gif)

In addition to this, your walkthrough video should show the POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for thoughts being tested in Insomnia.


In addition to this, your walkthrough video should show the POST and DELETE routes for reactions to thoughts being tested in Insomnia.

## Getting Started

Be sure to have MongoDB installed on your machine. Follow the [MongoDB installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb) to install MongoDB locally.



// example data
{
  "thoughtText": "Here's a cool thought...",
  "username": "lernantino",
  "userId": "5edff358a0fcb779aa7b118b"
}
```

* `PUT` to update a thought by its `_id`

* `DELETE` to remove a thought by its `_id`

### Walkthrough Video: 37%

* A walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the social media API must be submitted, and a link to the video should be included in your README file.
