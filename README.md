# 18 NoSQL: Social Network API

## Description

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. 
This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. I use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. 

## Installation
Clone the repo from GitHub, and install node.js on your computer, in the command line, run npm start.
